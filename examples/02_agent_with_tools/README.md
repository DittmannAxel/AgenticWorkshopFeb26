# Example 02: Foundry Agent with Tools

This example demonstrates the Foundry Agent Service with customer service tools — **text only, no voice**.

## What it does

1. Creates a Foundry Agent with CRM, Calendar, Order, and Ticket tools
2. Runs three sample German conversations:
   - **Bestellstatus**: Customer asks about order delivery
   - **Terminbuchung**: Customer books an appointment
   - **Beschwerde**: Customer reports a damaged delivery
3. Shows how the agent calls tools and formulates responses
